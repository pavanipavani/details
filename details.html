My sister's name is SINDHU, and my brother's names are Nani, MOKSHITH. He is a very naughty boy in our family. My sister and brother Mokshith are very naughty and they are very happy.And then we will play all the games at the top of the house.If there were no nature, we wouldnâ€™t be alive. Humankind is dependent on nature. We get oxygen to breathe from plants and trees. Thus, our respiratory system is regulated by nature. Not only this, nature has some magical healing powers which help patients suffering from various diseases to recover faster.
